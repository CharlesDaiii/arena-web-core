This repository contains the code for the ARENA browser client, an environment to view and interact in multiuser virtual and augmented reality. This environment was built using Web standards (notably, [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) and [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)) and frameworks for building 3D scenes and XR environments ([three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)).

We also take advantage of WASMâ€˜s availability in all major browsers and other platforms outside the browser to execute distributed XR applications (the browser runtime source is [here](https://github.com/conix-center/arena-runtime-browser)).
