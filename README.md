The [ARENA](conix.io/arena) is a platform for supporting real-time mixed reality (XR) interaction between multiple users and the physical world. 

This repository contains the code for the ARENA browser client, an environment to view and interact in multiuser virtual and augmented reality. This environment was built using Web standards (notably, [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) and [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)) and frameworks for building 3D scenes and XR environments ([three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)).

We also take advantage of WASMâ€˜s availability in all major browsers and other platforms outside the browser to execute distributed XR applications (the browser runtime source is [here](https://github.com/conix-center/arena-runtime-browser)).
