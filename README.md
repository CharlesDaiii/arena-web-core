# AframeSandbox
proof of concept code for visualization of primitives from MQTT messages

## References
This code originated as a clone of the demo for a tool that exports a Unity scene as an A-Frame page https://github.com/if1live/unity-scene-web-exporter .
It was then modified to do real-time updating of scene objects based on another demo ("networked AFrame" https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) and using MQTT in a browser https://github.com/reese-long/mqtt-browser-demo 

It now bears very little resemblance to the original, much commented out of `index.html`, and much added:

## Files
 * `mqtt.js` - Javascript to subscribe to MQTT topic(s) via wildcard, parse primitive-object messages, and add/remove AFrame Elements to the scene accordingly.
 The message format (as part of a higher level, more general "ARENA" system design plan for AR) is documented at work-in-progress  
https://conix.io/conix_mw/index.php?title=Spatial_Web/ARENA_Architecture#Pub.2FSub_Structure
 * `index.html` - mostly commented out AFrame HTML wrapper
 * `paho-mqtt.js` - a copy of (but not the location referenced in this code) the Eclipse Paho MQTT library, for convenient inspection
 * `cmds.sh` - linux commands to draw a small grid of test cylinders (to debug rotation)
 * `models/` - AFrame format model and material definitions for a space shuttle from the original demo scene
 * `CONIX.png` - a bitmap so we can draw the Conix logo on things (support for bitmaps on primitives is a TODO) that should really be in:
 * `images/` - a better place to store bitmaps :)
 * `shapes.py` - the most sandbox-like thing here: sample code to send random primitive shape draw commands as MQTT messages

## Commentary
Some hard-coded things:
 * MQTT broker running on `oz.andrew.cmu.edu` - runs with WebSockets enabled, because Paho MQTT needs to use WebSockets
 * MQTT topic structure is in flux. Used to be everything went to `/topic/render`, moving to `/topic/scene/#`. Each Object in the scene gets it's own topic, which is the 'name' of the object, e.g: `/topic/render/sphere_3` according to 
 * Naming convention: PrimitiveName_ID where Id is some unique identifier (integers for now), and PrimitiveName is something like 'sphere' 'cube' 'cylinder' etc.
 * MQTT draw messages set the 'Retain' flag such that new people visiting the page (example running at http://staines.andrew.cmu.edu/aframe) will see them. This is how to 'persist' things in the Scene. Otherwise set Retain to False or 'off' and the primitive gets drawn & seen only by those currently viewing the scene; a page re-load and they will disappear
 * Because of this, if you render a ton of retained things, there's a risk of spamming the scene. You might need to clean up by doing something like
  1. Get all the retained objects by subscribing to /topic/render/#
  2. Iterate through the ones you want to remove
  3. For each, issue a publish command to the object+topic, with retain set, and an empty message. This clears the topic. e.g:
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/sphere_3 -m "" -r
```
